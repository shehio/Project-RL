### What?
This website compiles a list of research papers to show how reinforcement learning (RL) has evolved over time. It’s a resource meant for novice researchers and hobbyists to learn more about breakthroughs in RL across the years.

### Why?
For many many decades, researchers have studied reinforcement Learning, a paradigm of machine learning capable of making intelligent decisions by studying sequences of correlated events. Researchers believed it could bring us closer to [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) one day.

Although it didn’t seem a promising field of research, true believers never lost sight. More importantly, they never lost hope. In the past few years, fueled by modern advances in deep learning, RL has successfully tackled many AI challenges. It still seems to be on a trajectory to change the world.

One time a computer program used RL to outperform humans in chess and go, games that have been studied and strategized for millenniums, after only training for a few hours by playing against itself. Other times, AI agents utilized RL to outscore pro players in classical Atari games and modern games like Dota and Starcraft.

These achievements didn’t go unnoticed, with keen researchers featured in various articles in top artificial intelligence conferences and the most prestigious journals: [Nature](https://www.nature.com/) and [Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/).

Although games have provided the perfect test environment, they're not everything reinforcement learning can do. RL shines in robotics, exploration rovers, and of course, self-driving cars. Moreover, it’s used in bid optimization in auctions and building world-class recommenders for your next song or movie.
